# Security-risk-assessment-report

**Scenario**

**Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.**

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 
After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:
The organization’s employees' share passwords.
The admin password for the database is set to the default.
The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 
If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 
In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further secure the network.


**Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement**


1. Password policies
2. MFA
3. Firewall maintenance




**Part 2: Explain your recommendations**


1. The company does not have any password policies in places and employees share the same passwords. This increases the risk of vulnerability. Enforcing password policies should be the first step in security hardening of the networks.
2. Alongside the previous point, MFA is a secure method to ensure that the authorized person has access to what they should have access to. This will reduce the risk of another data breach.
3. The company firewall needs to be updated and configured to protect the system from external threads. A new set of rules needs to be created ASAP e.g., port filtering, in order to give the network more security. Also, these rules need to be updated regularly according to the threads and conditions, at least every 2 weeks.
